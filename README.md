# About

This app was created as an interview demo for Quick Base. The app is an admin control of a product that allows builders to set up their own input form (e.g. how Google Forms, Survey Monkey, or Quick Base allow you to build a survey with a multiple choice field.) The app creates a control to modify the properties of a multiple choice field. 

# How to install
1. Clone or download repo "interview-app".
2. Download and save file to local folder.
3. On Command line, direct to local folder and run:

```
npm start
```

# How to use

## Label
In the "Label" field, type in the label you want for the builder. The label will be related to your choices. Clicking "Save Changes" at the bottom of the app will save the inputted label. 

## Type
Check the box if a value is required to be added to "Choices".

## Default value
A value in the "Default Value" field will show after clicking "Save Changes", which will save the value inputted into "Add Choice" to "Default Value".

## Add Choice
An input into "Add Choice" will be saved into the dropdown menu after clicking "Add Choice" button. The input field will clear when clicking "Add Choice" button. 

## Choices
This is a chronologically-ordered dropdown menu of choices saved from "Add choice" field, from which users can choose.

## Save Changes
The "Save Changes" button saves the input in "Add choice" field both to "Default value" field and "Choices" dropdown.

## Cancel
The "Cancel" button erases all inputs in fields.
